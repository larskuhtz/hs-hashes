# Revision history for the hashes package

## 0.3.0.1 -- 2024-08-20

*   Fix building the package on Gentoo.

Internal Changes:

*   Replace the Syd test framework by hspec.
*   Modernize the FFI interface with OpenSSL.

## 0.3.0 -- 2024-07-12

Breaking Changes:

*   Add type type parameter to support different output sizes for `Shake128` and
    `Shake256`.
*   Hash functions in `Data.Hash.Class.Mutable` and
    `Data.Hash.Class.Mutable.Salted` now run in `IO`, which is generally more
    efficient than a pure computation within `unsafePerformIO`. The modules also
    provide pure variants of the hash functions that can be used when the
    performance overhead of `unsafePerformIO` does not matter.
*   Drop support for OpenSSL < 1.1.

Other Changes:

*   Add support for Keccak224, Keccak384, Shake128/256,and Shake256/512.
*   Improved test coverage for OpenSSL based hashes.
*   Avoid deprecated API calls in the implementation of OpenSSL based hashes.
*   Add an IsString instance for OpenSSL based digests that uses hex encoding.
*   Improve heuristics for locating libcrypt on macOS.

## 0.2.3 -- 2022-11-22

*   Support reset and reuse of context for OpenSSL digests.
*   Avoid the use of deprecated OpenSSL methods.
*   Add methods to write digests directly to a pointer for Keccak digests.

## 0.2.2.1 -- 2022-09-28

*   Support for Apple Silicon (`aarch64_HOST_ARCH`)

## 0.2.2.0 -- 2022-08-20

*   Test suite for SHA hash functions
*   Fix openssl-3.0 support

## 0.2.1.1 -- 2021-10-23

*   Fixes for building with GHC-9.2

## 0.2.1.0 -- 2021-10-22

*   Add OpenSSL based implementation of Keccak-512.

## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-10-20

Breaking changes:

*   Add Class based interfaces for hash functions with pure and mutable
    contexts.
*   Support incremental hashing.
*   Provide type classes for hash functions with salt / key.
*   Add utility functions for hashing `ByteString`s.

Other changes:

*   Provide cryptographic hash functions from OpenSSL.

## 0.1.0.1 -- 2021-09-30

*   Support building with GHC-9.2.0-rc1

## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-09-29

* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
